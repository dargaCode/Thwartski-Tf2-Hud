//				  1. HOW DO I INSTALL THE SWAPPER?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

See thwartski_README.txt

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//				2. WHY CAN'T I REBIND MY KEYS IN-GAME?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to rebind your swapper keys through the in-game settings menu, 
you first have to delete thwartski_binds.cfg from the cfg folder.

Otherwise they'll just reset every time the game loads or you change classes.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//			  3. WHERE CAN I CHANGE MY BINDS IN CONFIGS?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
You can use the method described above to change them without editing a config file.

If you're comfortable editing configs, you can find the binds in /cfg/thwartski_binds.cfg

Each config has the sections that contain customization options marked with: **EDIT ME!**

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//				   4. HOW CAN I EDIT A .CFG FILE?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Right click on a config file and select Open. If you've never edited a cfg file before, 
you should see an option to select which software to open it with. 

Select Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (OSX) and check the option to remember this setting.
//						     FEEDBACK
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//				 5. DO I HAVE TO RESTART MY GAME?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

The first time you install the swapper, you'll need to restart TF2. 

After that, if you're editing something, all you have to so is save the config
and change classes. Then the configs will all be reloaded with the new settings. 

If you change anything in /cfg/autoexec.cfg though, you'll have to restart the game.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//			    6. WHY DOES MY CAMERA LOOK DIFFERENT?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

I changed your field of view (fov) to give you more peripheral vision.

I felt bad messing with it since it's not strictly part of this system, but it will
make a huge difference to your gameplay and I recommend giving it a try.

If you want to change it back, just go to /cfg/autoexec.cfg and edit the fov_desired
number (the comments will help you).

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//				 7. WHY DO MY ARMS LOOK DIFFERENT?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
Similarly, I changed the fov for viewmodels so they're not so obtrusive.

If you want to change them back to the valve defaults, open 
/cfg/thwartski_wepswapper_crosshairs.cfg and search for "defaultfov"

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//				  8. CAN I CHANGE MY WEAPON ORDER?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Use thwartski_wepswapper_[classname].cfg to modify the primary/secondary/tertiary
weapon definitions for each class.
	
For example, I recommend using medigun as medic's primary, and sticky launcher as demo's
primary. Any changes will apply to swapper buttons, number keys, and the scroll wheel.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//			    9. HOW DO I TURN OFF MY VIEWMODELS?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Open /cfg/thwartski_crosshairs.cfg and look under the section marked VIEWMODELS.

I recommend turning off all gun viewmodels but leaving on melee, so I've separated
the options out into two pieces. Just follow the instructions in the comments. 

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//		   10. HOW CAN I HIDE MY PYRO FLAMES OR HEAL BEAM?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

Your healing beam and pyro flames are visible by default, even when viewmodels 
are turned off. 

Edit /cfg/thwartski_wepswapper_pyro.cfg and /cfg/thwartski_wepswapper_medic.cfg to
see and modify these options. 

[However they can only be hidden if viewmodels are already turned off.]
	
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//				11. HOW DO I CHANGE MY CROSSHAIRS?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

/cfg/thwartski_crosshairs.cfg contains the definitions for each of the 4 crosshair 
categories I use. I use the following four groupings:

	A.	"Valve" for medigun, sapper, minigun, stickies, rockets, flames.
	B.	"Precise" for sniper, pistols, revolver.
	C.	"Spread" for shotguns, needles, smg, grenades.
	D.	"Melee" for melee.
	
Each /cfg/thwartski_wepswapper_[classname].cfg assigns a crosshair category for each 
weapon slot. 

You can create as many new categories as you want, or reassign weapons between
the existing categories. 

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//			  12. WHAT ARE THESE "ARON SETTINGS" FOR?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

Aron's Crosshair Switcher has a really nice visual editor that you can use to plan out
your crosshairs. 

Since I used it to plan out my 4 categories, I included my settings so you can use them
as a starting point for modifying your own if you want.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//		      13. HOW DO I USE THE ADVANCED SPY CONFIG?
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

Change /cfg/spy.cfg to point to /cfg/thwartski_wepswapper_spy_advanced.cfg to spy.cfg

This is for spies who want to have special settings for their weapon visibility when firing, 
and changing crosshairs to minimize the ambassador cooldown distraction. You know who you are.
