//This system makes it possible to use two buttons for all weapon swapping.
bind "Q" "leftswap"      //Swap the primary and secondary weapon. 
bind "E" "rightswap"     //Swap the secondary and tertiary weapons.
bind "R" "voicemenu 0 0" //Call for medic (which Valve had on E by default).

//Whether you hit a number key, scroll the mouse wheel, or use a swap button, your
//weapons and their crosshairs will be properly updated.
