These settings are for Aron's Crosshair Switcher (http://tinyurl.com/7xzb6sk). 
This program isn't required at all to use my scripts, it's just a nice way to plan your crosshairs. 

These settings will give you an idea what my crosshairs look like, or help you decide how to tweak them. 
Just paste the following into the /settings/settings.ini file that's created after you run his app:
