//						ABOUT THWARTSKI HUD
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thwartski Hud is for advanced users of TF2 who want a simpler UI with fewer 
fancy images, fullscreen backgrounds, and less explanatory text.

It emphasizes important tactical information as much as possible, and minimizes 
strategic information to where it's not so obtrusive. 

Thwartski Hud is inspired by and incorporates the best bits of 6 huds: 
Broesel, CommHud, Eve, FrankenHud, Maco, Oxide, RevanXP, and Toasty.

//						  ABOUT THWARTSKI
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a professional game designer who plays a decent amount of TF2. My comp ability
is still low, but believe I know enough to design for high level comp players.

I try to play all nine classes so I can tailor things to each of them. My current 
main is soldier. It was originally pyro, then engie, then sniper, then spy.
