//						       ABOUT
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

//Inspired by Aron's Crosshair Switcher: (http://tinyurl.com/7xzb6sk)
//Even if you use my system, I recommend using Aron's nice visual editor to design your crosshairs.
//See thwartski-bonus-Aron-settings.txt to use my settings as a starting point.

//When playing without viewmodels, having a different crosshair for all 3 weapon slots is important.
//This config defines all my crosshairs and viewmodel categories.
//These are later assigned per weaponslot in each class's thwartski_crosshair_[classname].cfg

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//					       CUSTOMIZATION
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

//Since all crosshairs are tracked in one place, they are easy to use and adjust for multiple weapons at a time.
//You can define a different crosshair for every weapon if you want, but I use four categories:
	//I use xhairdefault for weapons that look best with the Valve crosshairs.
	//I use xhairprecise for weapons that fire a single accurate bullet.
	//I use xhairspread for innaccurate weapons such as buckshot. 
	//I use xhairmelee for all melee weapons.
	
//For this system, crosshairs also include whether or not viewmodels are visible. 
//You can turn viewmodels on and off as much as you like between weapons.
//I recommend getting used to the swapper with viewmodels on, then turning them off for all but melee weapons.
	
//You can also change crosshair colors between weapons, but I just use the same color for all mine.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//						CROSSHAIR DEFINITIONS            **EDIT ME!**
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

//I use default for medigun, sapper, minigun, stickies, rocket launcher, and flamethrower.
alias xhairdefault 	"colorbrightgreen; usedforguns;  exec thwartski_wepswapper_xhairreset"

//I use precise for sniper rifle, pistols, and revolver. Mine is a small cross with a dot in center.
alias xhairprecise 	"colorbrightgreen; usedforguns;  cl_crosshair_file crosshair1; cl_crosshair_scale 28"

//I use spread for shotguns, needles, smg, and grenades. Mine is a small circle.
alias xhairspread 	"colorbrightgreen; usedforguns;  cl_crosshair_file crosshair3; cl_crosshair_scale 30"

//I  use melee for all melee weapons. Mine is a fairly large X.
alias xhairmelee 	"colorbrightgreen; usedformelee; cl_crosshair_file crosshair4; cl_crosshair_scale 50"

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//						  CROSSHAIR COLORS               **EDIT ME!**
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

//You can also change crosshair colors between weapons, but I just use bright green for all of mine.
//RGB values have ranges from 0 to 255. Alpha is opacity. 
alias colorbrightgreen "cl_crosshair_red 0; cl_crosshair_green 255;cl_crosshair_blue 0; cl_crosshairalpha 200"

//							VIEWMODELS                   **EDIT ME!**
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

//There are benefits to leaving viewmodels on for melee weapons, so you can time your swings better. 
//These aliases make it easy to hide weapons for everything, or for everything except melee weapons.
alias usedforguns  "hideweapons" //I recommend changing this to "hideweapons" when you're ready.
alias usedformelee "showweapons" //I recommend leaving this as "showweapons."

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//							 TRACERS
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

//Hide or reveal the weapon viewmodels and the tracer FX of bullets flying through the air.
//Don't worry, hiding tracers won't hide anything useful like bullet holes or rockets.
alias showweapons "r_drawviewmodel 1;showtracers"
alias hideweapons "r_drawviewmodel 0;viewmodel_fov 0" 

//I lied! Tracers include two important things (needles, heal beam) and one arguably-useful thing (flames).
//I use this command from thwartski_weapons_medic.cfg and thwartski_weapons_pyro.cfg to re-enable them.
//This also determines your viewmodel perspective. I like 70 but you can adjust it. 
alias showtracers "viewmodel_fov 70"
