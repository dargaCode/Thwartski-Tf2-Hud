echo "CONFIG EXECUTED - THWARTSKI WEAPONSWAP"


//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//							EXPLANATION
//-------------------------------------------------------------------


//I repurpose the "lastwep" button that tf2 already has to switch between the first two weapons,
//And add another swap button to move between the second two weapons.

//To use soldier as an example:

//Rocket launcher is selected automatically at spawn.
//Hitting Q repeatedly cycles between rocket launcher and shotgun (same as Valve defaults).
//Hitting E swaps to equalizer.
//Hitting E repeatedly cycles between equalizer and shotgun.
//Hitting Q swaps back to rocket launcher.
//etc.

//While this is happening, custom crosshairs and model visibility are also being applied.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//					   PRIMARY/SECONDARY SWAP

BIND Q "mainswap"

//Cycle between the primary and secondary weapons.

//					    BINDS AND SETTINGS
//-------------------------------------------------------------------


//These are just failsafe settings for basic functionality. 
//They're only used if weapons and crosshairs aren't specified in the thwartski_weapons_[class] configs

alias equipprimary "slot1"  
alias equipsecondary "slot2"
alias equiptertiary "slot3" 


//Remember selected weapon on respawn. EVERYTHING about weapons and crosshairs breaks if this is disabled.
//Sadly class configs execute on class change, not every spawn. Otherwise I'd love to turn this off. 

tf_remember_activeweapon 1


//Don't use that weird weapon menu on the right, just load the weapon. 
//If this setting is changed, the swapper will have all kinds of problems. 
//Besides, the whole point is to get at your weapons more easily, without needed so much feedback.
