//Inspired by Aron's Crosshair Switcher: (http://tinyurl.com/7xzb6sk)
//Even if you use my system, I recommend using Aron's app to plan out how you'd like your crosshairs to look.


//I learned from Aron's configs, but decided to make my own so I could easily group my weapons into the same 4 crosshair themes
//You can define as many as you like, but calling them from their own config like this makes for easy editing of multiple weapons


//for weapons that should keep the valve crosshair.
//I use this for medigun, sapper, minigun, stickies, and flamethrower.

//I use this for sniper rifle, pistols, and revolvers. (small circle)
