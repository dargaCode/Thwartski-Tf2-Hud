echo "CONFIG EXECUTED - CROSSHAIRS"

//Inspired by Aron's Crosshair Switcher: (http://tinyurl.com/7xzb6sk)
//I recommend using his app to plan out how you'd like your crosshairs to look.

//I learned from Aron's configs, but decided to make my own so I could easily group my weapons into the same 4 crosshair themes
//You can define as many as you like, but calling them from their own config like this makes for easy editing of multiple weapons

alias xhairdefault 	"gunweps;exec defaultcrosshair"
//for weapons that should keep the valve crosshair. I use this for medigun, sapper, minigun, stickies, and flamethrower.

alias xhairprecise 	"gunweps;cl_crosshair_file crosshair1;cl_crosshair_scale 28"
//for weapons that fire one very accurate bullet. I use this for sniper rifle, pistols, and revolvers. (small circle)

alias xhairspread 	"gunweps;cl_crosshair_file crosshair3;cl_crosshair_scale 30"
//for buckshot weapons or weapons with gravity. I use this for shotguns, needles, and grenades. (cross with dot in center)

alias xhairmelee 	"meleeweps;cl_crosshair_file crosshair4;cl_crosshair_scale 50"
//for all melee weapons. (large x)
