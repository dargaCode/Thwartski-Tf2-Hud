echo "CONFIG EXECUTED - THWARTSKI WEAPONSWAP"


//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//							EXPLANATION
//-------------------------------------------------------------------


//I think it's silly to mess with scroll wheels and number keys in a game with so few weapon slots. 
//Every class has only three weapons, aside from the pdas which can be handled elsewhere. 

//With three weapons, only two are possible options to switch to at any given time. 
//This means only 2 buttons are required for perfect weaponswapping.

//I repurpose the "lastwep" button tf2 already has to switch between the first two weapons,
//And add another swap button to move between the second two weapons.

//Combined with the crosshair swapping that comes with it,
//This system allowed me to be confident enough with my weapon selecting to finally turn off viewmodels.

//To use soldier as an example:

//Rocket launcher is selected automatically at spawn.
//Hitting Q repeatedly cycles between rocket launcher and shotgun (same as valve defaults).
//Hitting E swaps to equalizer.
//Hitting E repeatedly cycles between equalizer and shotgun.
//Hitting Q swaps back to rocket launcher.
//etc.

//This system becomes completely subconscious very quickly,
//And I feel pretty strongly that everyone should give it a try =)

//Remember selected weapon on respawn. EVERYTHING about weapons and crosshairs breaks if this is disabled.
//Sadly class configs execute on class change, not every spawn. Otherwise I'd love to turn this off.
