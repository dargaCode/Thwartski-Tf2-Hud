echo "CONFIG EXECUTED - THWARTSKI CROSSHAIRS"


//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//							EXPLANATION
//-------------------------------------------------------------------


//This config generally defines all my crosshairs and viewmodel settings. 
//These are specified per class in each class's thwartski_crosshair_[class].cfg

//Inspired by Aron's Crosshair Switcher: (http://tinyurl.com/7xzb6sk)
//Even if you use my system, I recommend using Aron's nice visual editor to design your crosshairs.
//See thwartski-Aron-settings.txt

//I learned from Aron's configs, but needed to make my own so they'd work with my weaponswap system. 
//Also his crosshairs are defined seperately by weapon for every class, 
//And I knew I wanted to have many weapons share the same settings,
//So this method is much easier to maintain and tweak.

//You can define as many crosshairs as you like, but I've found that four categories works well:
//Valve Defaults, Precise, Spread, and Melee.

//You could also change crosshair colors between weapons, 
//But I just define mine as bright green in thwartski_resetsettings.cfg and never change them.


//-------------------------------------------------------------------
//						CROSSHAIR DEFINITIONS
//-------------------------------------------------------------------


//Default is for weapons that should keep the valve crosshair.
//I use this for medigun, sapper, minigun, stickies, rocket launcher, and flamethrower.
//Reverting to the valve crosshair has to happen in its own config, due to a problem with nested quotes.

alias xhairdefault 	"gunweps;exec thwartski_resetcrosshair"

//Precise is for weapons that fire a single accurate bullet.
//I use this for sniper rifle, pistols, and revolver.
//Mine is a small cross with dot in center

alias xhairprecise 	"gunweps;cl_crosshair_file crosshair1;cl_crosshair_scale 28"


//Spread is for innaccurate weapons such as buckshot or projectiles with gravity. 
//I use this for shotguns, needles, smg, and grenades.
//Mine is a small circle

alias xhairspread 	"gunweps;cl_crosshair_file crosshair3;cl_crosshair_scale 30"


//Melee is for all melee weapons. 
//Mine is a large X

alias xhairmelee 	"meleeweps;cl_crosshair_file crosshair4;cl_crosshair_scale 50"

//							VIEWMODELS
//-------------------------------------------------------------------


//While many people hide weapons, leaving them on for melee can improve swing timing.
//These aliases make it easy to hide weapons for everything, or for everything except melee weapons.
//If you're getting used to the weaponswap system, you can set gunweps to showmodels for the first few days.

alias gunweps "hideweapons"
alias meleeweps "showweapons"

alias showweapons "showmodels;showtracers"
alias hideweapons "hidemodels;hidetracers"


//These simply hide or reveal the weapon models in your firstperson view. 
//These can also be overridden in particular class configs to force particular weapons on or off.
//I use showmodels and hidemodels in thwartski_weapons_spy.cfg to force spy viewmodels on and off.

alias showmodels "r_drawviewmodel 1"
alias hidemodels "r_drawviewmodel 0" 


//Changing the viewmodel fov to 0 hides the tracer fx which you may notice on hitscan weapons. 
//The bulletholes will still be displayed, just not the streaks through the air which can mess up timing.

//These can also be overridden in particular class configs to force particular tracers on or off.
//I have forced tracers on for medigun and needles in thwartski_weapons_medic.cfg
//Without this, you wouldn't be able to see the needle projectiles, or the healing beam connecting you. 
//I've left my flamethrower flames off, but you could also force those on in thwartski_weapons_pyro.cfg

alias showtracers "viewmodel_fov 70"
alias hidetracers "viewmodel_fov 0"
